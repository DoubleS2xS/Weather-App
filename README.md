#  Weather-App

A lightweight, responsive, and theme-switchable weather application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It fetches current weather data and presents it with a clean UI and persistent local storage for user preferences.

##  Features

-  **Current Weather** – Displays temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and wind information for the selected location.
-  **Location Search** – Lets users search for weather by city name.
-  **Theme Toggle** – Switch effortlessly between Light and Dark modes.
-  **Local Storage** – Saves the last searched city and theme preference for seamless user experience on revisit.
-  **Responsive Design** – Optimized for desktops, tablets, and mobile screens.

##  Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Structured and semantic markup.
- **CSS3** – Styled with responsive layout and theme support.
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – Manages API calls, DOM updates, events, and local storage.
- **Weather API** – Integrates with a third-party service (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) for live data.


##  How It Works

1. **User Interaction** – Upon entering a city and submitting, an API request is sent to fetch current weather data (latitude, temperature, humidity, etc.).
2. **Display Logic** – The app updates the UI to show weather details and relevant icons or backgrounds to match conditions.
3. **Persistence** – Both the city and theme preferences are saved in `localStorage`, ensuring they persist even after refreshing or reopening the app.
